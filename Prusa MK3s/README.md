## **:Next section needs to be changed**  
## **:interrobang:What do those hardware changes mean for your config?**  
**:wrench:Motors, microstepping resolution, and steps/mm.**  
Unless you have the same setup as referenced above, you may have to change the microstepping resolution and the steps per millimeter located in the 'config.g' file. To retrieve your current machine's configuration, issue an M503 command in the terminal connected to the running printer. Pay attention to the microstepping assigned to the axis as that can change your steps per millimeter. Read through the /sys/config.g file comments and make the applicable changes as needed.  *More about this can be read here: https://duet3d.dozuki.com/Wiki/Choosing_and_connecting_stepper_motors, here: https://www.linearmotiontips.com/microstepping-basics/, and here: https://blog.prusaprinters.org/calculator3416/.*  

:warning:Once you have changed/verified the motor settings, review the networking top portion of the file. When completed, copy all the files located in the 'sys', 'macros', and 'filaments' directory over to your sd-card. The 'www' and 'gcode' folder are present in the repository for reference and should not be needed to copy over to the sd-card in normal circumstances. *More can be read about sd-card here: https://duet3d.dozuki.com/Wiki/SDCard, more can be read about macros here: https://duet3d.dozuki.com/Wiki/Macros.*  

**:wrench:Sensorless Homing / Stallguard sensitivity.**  
The TMC2660 drivers used on the Duet WiFi support the stallGuard feature. This feature allows the driver to detect motor stalls under some circumstances. Stall detection may be useful for detecting when a motor has skipped steps due to the nozzle hitting an obstruction, and for homing the printer without using endstop switches.  
As the given configuration files were authored while using 0.9 degree stepper motors on the X and Y axis, you may need to adjust your stallguard sensitivity and sensorless homing. For stallguard sensitivity, look for the "M915" in the current-sense-homing.g and current-sense-normal.g files. *Read the full documentation here: https://duet3d.dozuki.com/Wiki/Stall_detection_and_sensorless_homing.*

**:bulb:Use the included Macros for filament handling.**  
To make filament loading, unloading, and changing the most straightforward and simplistic possible evolution, I have made a macro set that is readily accessible from the PanelDue.  To take full advantage of the duet filament system, you will need to make the system filaments PLA, PETG, ABS, and PC. This will allow you to have custom instructions for each different filament, by adding such to the filament's config.g file. *!Note: Based on the current macro version, it is required that each filament's load.g and unload.g remain empty. Placing code into these files will make these macros fail.*  
**"Set Filament Type"** asks what type of filament you are going to use; PLA, PETg, ABS, or PC. Based on the selection, this macro rewrites the "Heat Nozzle" macro to heat the nozzle for the selected filament type.  *!Note: This macro only has to be executed once for the given filament type change as it's settings are nonvolatile, regardless of reset or power off. !Note: The script will not let you change the filament type while filament is loaded.*   
**"Filament Handling"** is for any filament unloading, loading, and changing regardless of the printer's state, printing or not. This macro will load, unload, and change filament based on two conditions; whether it detects filament is currently loaded or not, and if a print is in progress or not.  *!Note: The logic function in the macro retrieves the current status of the filament sensor to base the perceived desired action to enact. If your printer's filament is currently empty and you intend to load filament, please do not place it into the extruder until requested to do so by the macro. Else the macro will determine that filament is loaded and that you desire to unload filament, instead of load.*   
**"Heat Nozzle"** is created by the "Set Filament Type" macro and can be selected to heat the hotend to the set temperature for the last chosen filament type. You do not need to run this to change filament. The "Filament Handling" macro automatically runs this macro to perform the heating of the hotend to carry out the filament handling, whether it be loading, unloading, or changing.  
**"Hotmesh"** preforms a bed mesh probing routine with a heat stabilized bed. This macro will heat the bed based on the currently set system filament type, wait 5 minutes for the bed temperature to stabilize, and then perform mesh probe. Once initiated, the nozzle will rise to 150mm and then lower 15mm for every 30 seconds elapsed - about minutes 5 in total. Once the nozzle is at the bed, the mesh probing cycle will commence.  
"**Save-Z-Baby**" is a tool to assist with making the current baby-steps permanent to be used after the first layer calibration print has been completed. This macro subtracts the current babystep offset from the current Z trigger height and informs the user what offset value to change the G31 Z metric to in the 0:/sys/config.g. Additionally, the macro issues a G31 command with the new calculated z-offset, clears the current babystepping, and then rehomes the machine to make the new z-offset effective. If this is for a specific filament type, recommend placing this yielded information in the filament's config.g - not the 0:/sys/config.g.  

![Start Screen](Start-screen.jpg)

## **Print flow events:**   
When initiating a print, the following sequence of events occurs in this order.  
**/sys/start.g** is the first codeset that starts at the beginning of each print. This contains the generic processes that apply to all filament types. From this codeset, the fillament's config.g is called and then the bed is heat-stabilized for 2 minutes. To aid in time elapsed indication, the hotend / Z axis is raised and slowly lowered to the bed. Once the hotend is at bed level, the prescribed time has for bed stabilization has elapsed.  
**/filaments/PETG/config.g** is the second codeset initiated. This is triggered from the "M703" command in the "start.g" file. As written in this example, we are set to use the PETG "config.g" file, located in the "filaments/PETG" directory. This contains the gcode commands that are particular to PETG filament type.  
**Slicer's Start GCode** is the last bit of codeset to be executed before the object's sliced gcode starts. This contains the settings particular to the actual print and the exact PETG filament loaded. This would be your *'fine'* settings, where PETG/config.g could be considered your *'medium'* settings, and start.g would be the *'rough'* - performing evaluations to get the printer ready.    
**The part's actual gcode** made by the slicer.  
**Slicer's End GCode** follows the printed object's gcode. This codeset lets the duet know that the print is finished which calls  
 **/sys/stop.g**, the very last codeset that is executed. This last part commonly shutdowns heaters, retracts a bit of filament, turns part cooling fan to 100% to solidify filament for 2 minutes, and then positions the machine to easily retrieve the printed part.

## **Additional notes:**  
**:bulb:Electrically independent Z motors**: On printers, such as MK3, which uses two Z motors to raise/lower the bed or gantry, you can have the firmware probe the bed and adjust the motors individually to eliminate tilt.  The auto calibration uses a least-squares algorithm that minimizes the sum of the height errors. The deviation before and expected deviation after calibration is reported. Run G32 to initiate the process. *Read the full documentation here: https://duet3d.dozuki.com/Wiki/Bed_levelling_using_multiple_independent_Z_motors.*  

**:bulb:PINDA v2**: Pinda version 2 is upgraded from the previous version in that it now has an integrated thermistor, which this configuration electrically ties to thermistor E1 on the duet.  Pinda temperature compensation has to be mitigated via g-code macro but will be handled via integrated function within the duet firmware shortly.  *Read @Argo's posting in the Duet forums: https://forum.duet3d.com/topic/16972/pinda-2-probe-with-temperature-compensation?_=1593546022132.*    

**:bulb:BLTouch v3.1**: The config.g has comment sections for using this probe and the wiring guide covers the electrical installation of the BLTouch v3.1 in the last few pages. *Read the full documentation here: https://duet3d.dozuki.com/Wiki/Connecting_a_Z_probe*
